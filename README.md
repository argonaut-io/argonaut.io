[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/argonaut-io/argonaut.io.png)](https://travis-ci.org/argonaut-io/argonaut.io)

### What is Argonaut?

See <argonaut.io>


### How to work with this project?

You need jekyll installed. Then it works like any other <http://pages.github.com/> site.

There are a few conveniences included in the `Makefile`.

To run up a localserver on, `http://localhost:4000`:

    make


To publish to site:

    make publish

Note that this publishes current origin/master of your repo, be somewhat careful.

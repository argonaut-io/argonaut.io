<h1>Json Access, Traversal and Update</h1>

<div id="content">

<h2>Lenses</h2>

<p>
Argonaut includes lenses as a method of accessing and updating fields within instances of the Json type,
as lenses compose it's also possible to modify deeply nested fields.
</p>

<p>
Note that Json is an immutable data type modification using lenses produces new values each time.

<h2>Cursor</h2>

<p>
A <a href="http://argonaut.io/scaladocs/#argonaut.Cursor">Cursor</a> (otherwise known as a zipper)
provides the ability to move around the structure of the Json as if it were structured as a tree.
Operations like left and right are available to move forwards and backwards through a JSON array.
The downField method drops down into a given field of an object. Methods that modify elements
such as delete or withFocus operate in relation to the current position of the cursor.

<h2>Using Argonaut with SBT</h2>

<p>Depending on argonaut with sbt, stable:</p>
<pre>
"io.argonaut" %% "argonaut" % "6.0-M5"
</pre>
<p>Depending on argonaut with sbt, latest:</p>
<pre>
"io.argonaut" %% "argonaut" % "6.0-SNAPSHOT" changing()
</pre>

<h2>What your code will look like?</h2>

<p>
To get a feel for the power of argonaut. We present the following
example that leverages the parser, codecs and zipper to process a
response from the twitter search api.

<pre class="prettyprint lang-scala linenums" id="example_TweetExample">
</pre>

The remainder of the documentation will build up from the basics to
give you a complete understanding of the API.


<h2>A Starting Example</h2>

<p>
As JSON tends to be at the boundary of most services the common case is to process some values from JSON,
do some computation with said values and then produce more JSON for a response.
</p>

For example:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-scala linenums" id="example_RequestResponse">
</pre>

</div>
